- The "Main_PSO.m" file will execute a optimization rotine that creates a neural controller for the power split problem in electric vehicles with hybrid storage.

- The main code uses "MicroMovCycle.mat" as training data, this set is generated by "MicromovementPower.m" code. Alternatively, a validation set, "EPAUDDSCycle.mat", is used and can generated by "CyclePower.m" code.

- The best particle found in this designing process can be loaded throught the "BestParticleXg.mat" file. The code "TestSolution.m" can test and present graphs for a particular solution under different initial conditions. It is already setted to show that best particle results.
